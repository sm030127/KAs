## Description of my solution

Talk us through your solution, thought process etc here.

1. Created basic atomic compoenets in a reusable fashion.
2. To make the application performant, inlined critical css.
3. Broken down components into simpler components.
4. Made the application responsive so that it works properly in desktop, tab and mobile screen
5. Used latest features like Hooks.

About the Flow - On First render of the component details of first user is loaded along with a fetch user button.
Clicking on fetch button would fetch another user and new user will be appended to the list.
After fetching 5 users the button will not be visible

## Things I would do next

1. Improving the ui a bit more.
2. Adding a Delete user functionality
3. Making the application more performant

## Assumptions that I made

After fetching 5 users the button will not be visible.
